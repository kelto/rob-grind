## Polymorphism

### Explanation

First we have to understand that EVERYTHING in java is object, except primitive (char, int, short, long, double, float and boolean). Even for primitive there is an Object for them : char => Character, int => Integer, short => Short, long => Long, double => Double, float => Float, boolean => Boolean.
So in fact, since everything except primitive is an Object in java, we can use everything as an Object.
