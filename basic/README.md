## Polymorphism

### Explanation

First we have to understand that EVERYTHING in java is object, except primitive (char, int, short, long, double, float and boolean). Even for primitive there is an Object for them : char => Character, int => Integer, short => Short, long => Long, double => Double, float => Float, boolean => Boolean.
So in fact, since everything except primitive is an Object in java, we can use everything as an Object.

### Basic of casting and Polymorphism (Difficulty Easy/Medium)
Let's try to run this file : [BasicCast.java](BasicCast.java)  

### Polymorphism and Inheritance (Difficulty : Medium/Hard)
Concept with more details with all the classes in [Mamal/](Mamal)  
The [Mamal/MainMamal.java](Main file) will show you how to use inheritance on your Object, and how we can cast them between each other.
Then we can see how it might work with some functions in [Mamal/MainPoly.java](MainPoly)
